# (No-Show-Appointment Dataset Investigation)
## by (Olatunji Jola)


## Dataset
The dataset is for a social welfare 
program of the Government of Brazil **Bolsa Familia**. It was analyzed to show 
how various factors contributed to whether a patient show up 
for an appointment or not and to discover the most important 
predictor or combination of predictors to whether a patient 
will show up.

## Summary of Findings

> In this analysis our focus has been on discovering factors that best describe 
the show or no_show condition of the appointment status.

- Gender is not a strong indicator as the difference in show rate between the two 
gender is less than 1%.The show rate for male is slightly higher at 80% while that 
of the female is at 79.7%

- Age is a stronger indicator of no_show as the rate of no_show is low for children 
within the age group of 0-2 at 17.5% then increases continously until it peaks at 
the teenage group 14-18 at 25%. Then continues to reduce for adults before reaching 
its minimum for age group between 65-78 at 15% and then start to increase and peaks 
at age group 99-115 at 27%.

- This describes the dire need for health care for babies under the age of 2 and the
increased conciousness towards healthy living as one become adult. Also, the tendency
for the aged ones between the ages 79 to 115 to need the help of others to help 
maintain their health.

- The waiting time is another strong indicator. It can be observed that the general 
trend is that, the more the waiting time the more the rate of No_show. This is not a
linear relationship but it is easy to spot that the lowest no_show rate is for 
waiting_period less than 20 days at 17% this is more than doubled for waiting period
of up to 160 days at 45%.

- When considering the waiting _periods within 20 days, we can see a steady increase
in no_show rate as the waiting _period increases.

- The ailment type is flat. Although, the rate of no show is highest among the alcoholism 
group at 20%, this is not much different from the diabetes and hypertension group at
18% and 17% respectively.

- The handicap type is a strong indicator of the show rate we can see that handicap 
type 1 has the lowest no show rate at 17.8%, this increases steadily across the 
handicap type 2 and 3 peaking at 33% for handicap type 4 

- It can also be observed that sponsorship(i.e enrollment status into the Bolsa 
Familia welfare program) has a strong effect on the no_show rate across the 
different handicap type group particularly for the type 2 Handicap group where 
there is 5.5% no show rate with sponsorship and 21.8% no_show rate without 
sponsorship.
